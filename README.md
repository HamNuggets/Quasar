# Quasar
my take on a tiny toolhead for a tiny printer

This is designed for use with (Rudy)[https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/Rudy], a corexy printer designed by Razorsh4rk. It aims to offer direct drive in a space efficient manner, since currently the only direct drive option is DDrudy.

# Sourcing Guide

i havent counted it but you need like
- a handful of brass inserts and screws (m2.5x⌀3.5x3, m3x⌀5x5)
- two 4010 fans
- a sherpa micro
- a v6 hotend
- some petg or abs

# Printing Guide

honestly print it in whatever the fuck you want, just not pla
it's designed to be best with petg (as Rudy is), but honestly abs will work too if that's what you have on hand

orient your shit like this
